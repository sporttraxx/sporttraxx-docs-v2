To setup the timing service of an event the following info are requested:
* List of clocks (ID) assigned to specific places
* Itinerary of race

Forward these information to Sporttraxx.

The next steps are actually reserved to Sporttraxx Administrators. In the coming
future, Sporttraxx Team members will be trained to setup events.
