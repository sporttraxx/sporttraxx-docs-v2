This page shows all the relevant information about the trackers and their connection status. Its graphic structure is more suitable than the [Overview](overview.md) page for events with many competitors as it avoids the continuous scrolling up and down along a vertical list.

## Buttons
The **Sorting** button can order the list of devices by:: 
* _**Competitor's number**_ 
* _**Starting order**_ 
* _**Position age**_

The **Connected** button shows the connection status.

The **Device Info** button shows the GPS validity (x non valid) and the battery level.

## Colors meaning

Each time the page refreshes (automatically), the competitor's box will be:
* Green if position age is <30sec.
* Light green if 30 to 75 sec. 
* Yellow if 75 to 150 sec. 
* Orange if 150 to 300 sec.
* Red if >5 min.

The outer border is blue if speed = 0 Km/h = not moving
Moving the cursor on an icon shows its name
## Competitor's info

Clicking on the competitor's box opens a detail box with info such as competitor's race number, competitor's name, coordinates, time since last transmission, current speed and associated device(s) if any.  
The _**Request position**_ button sends an update request to that tracker.
