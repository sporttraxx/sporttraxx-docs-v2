As an alternative tool to the [Map2D](map2d), where vehicles are running along twisty tracks, this page shows the advancing of all competitors, according to their starting order, on horizontal bars. The vertical lines show relevant waypoints of the imported KML file. 

![TP Page](/img/screenshots/tp2.png)

Competitors' icons run from left to right, showing their actual speed and their status using the same colours as in the [Map2D](map2d). Up to all the stages and the road sections can be switched on or off,  and the competitor's  lists can be synchronized and scrolled up and down.


## Functions

### Legenda

### Speed

### Editable
Switch _on_ and _off_ to be able to move manually (drag and drop) the icon along its line, in case of missing automatic update of position. **Note**: do **NEVER** push manually an icon along its line, if you are not 100% sure about its exact location (available only in multi line mode)
