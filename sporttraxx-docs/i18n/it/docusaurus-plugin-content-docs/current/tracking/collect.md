## Functions

### Collect
Type the number of the vehicle whose tracker you are collecting and press enter. 
A box will confirm the ID number of that device (eventually you might see 2 tracker’s IDs because that vehicle was also having an alias, that you are eventually also collecting). If you indeed have in your hands that (or those 2) devices, then confirm pressing the **Collect** button.  
If that number has already been collected, and you are mistyping the number of another device, overwrite it with the correct number and confirm.  
If the typing mistake happened earlier and you are indeed typing the number of the tracker you have now, then you will get a notification saying:  “_set as not collected_”, then, by pressing on it , you cancel the previous note. At this point you can retype that number and proceed. Do not forget to manage the previous mistake.  
  ### Vehicles
The list of vehicles is shown and for the collected ones a small icon will be displayed.
