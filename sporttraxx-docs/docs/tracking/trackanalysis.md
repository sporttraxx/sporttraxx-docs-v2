## Use

1. Select the date/time window of the investigation.
2. Select a competitor from the scroll- down list.  
3. Using the **Load Track** button choose:
* **Download track** for one or more  selected trackers only
* **Load all** to download the tracks for all trackers. That might take some time and challenge the computerâ€™s performance.
4. One or more trackers will have been downloaded and listed on top of the map.
5. Using the **Normal/Multi Replay** button choose a single playback of a selected trackerâ€™s history or a multi replay of all downloaded trackers.  

In the map, the track line(s) is shown, with its speed diagram on the bottom. 

Scrolling the cursor below the map, from left to right, you play back the run of that tracker. Leaving the cursor on the slider you can advance and return second by second by using the ðŸ ˜ e ðŸ š keys. Leaving the cursor in any point of the map you can advance and return position by position using the PageðŸ ™ and PageðŸ › keys. 

Selecting an area in the speed diagram, you can enlarge it, up to several times. Return to the full day diagram with double click on it.

If more trackers have been downloaded, you can select one by clicking on its name. If you want to play back all of them, then select the **Multi Replay** option. 

You can change color by clicking on its name.

The **Alarms** button shows where SOS/OK/ADA/GMW buttons have been pressed, along the track.

The **Chart** button allows the use of speed diagrams and shows track point details in the box in the map. 

The **x** button removes that tracker from the page.
