This page is the evolution of [Track Analysis](trackanalysis).

![Timing Page](/img/screenshots/trackanalysis2.png)

## Differences from Track Analysis
1. MapBox maps instead of Google Maps.
2. Once the date/time window has been selected, all the competitors tracks are immediately available in the left column and they can be selected. You can change a competitorâ€™s color by clicking on its colored square in the list.
3. The Playback cursor can be moved manually or an automatic replay option can be started with speed up to 40x.
4. Multi-Synchro Playback: in Multi mode, clicking on a SS Point just after the start, all selected competitors are virtually synchronized on that start and played back as if they would have started at the same time.
5. Speed diagram can be displayed/hidden using the **^** button.
6. Selecting/deselecting one or more competitor(s) from the left column, their tracks are immediately displayed/hidden on the map.
