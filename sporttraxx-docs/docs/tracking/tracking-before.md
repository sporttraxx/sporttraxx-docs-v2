To setup the tracking service of an event the following info and files are required:

* Name and dates of the event
* **Logo of the event (FORMAT DIMENSIONS) ?**
* List of vehicles (competitors and service vehicles)
* KML file of the race track (including relevant details and waypoints as Start/Finish/Tcs/Service/HQ) for the Race Control links ([Map2D](map2d), [Map](map), [TP](tp), [Track Analysis](trackanalysis) and [Timing](../timing/timing))
* KML file of the public link (if any)
* List of additional users with specified access

Edit files according to [this document](../kml_files) and forward these information to Sporttraxx.

The next setup procedures are actually reserved to Sporttraxx Administrators.  
In the coming future, Sporttraxx Team members will be trained to setup events.
