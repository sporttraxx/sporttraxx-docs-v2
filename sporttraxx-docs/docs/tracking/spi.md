The Performance Indicator is the tool which allows the evaluation of the overall quality of
the Sporttraxx trcking service during an event.
It is based on the regular and continuous monitoring of the connection status of all the
trackers associated to competitors only. Retired competitors (out), service vehicles and
spare units are excluded from this analysis.

The reliability of the generated data is based on the strict respect of the [Sporttraxx
Operating Protocol](sop).
