## Description

The SOS button is not very useful as it is very small and not easy to locate.

The holes on the bottom allow the use of the UK craddle.

## ON/OFF

This tracker can be ideally switched on/off using the [Killer](tools/killer) tool. It can also be turned on from remote or by its own on/off button: short press to turn on, longer press (2 seconds) to turn off. It might take some seconds.
